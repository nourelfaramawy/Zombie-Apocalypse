# Choice-Driven Narrative Game Project

In this project, the main aim is to create a choice-driven narrative game, where players have the agency to shape the story through their decisions. Unlike traditional linear narratives, this game will provide players with multiple decision points, each leading to different consequences and branching paths.

## Project Overview
Video games offer a unique interactive experience, allowing players to actively engage with the story and shape its outcome. Choice-driven narrative games take this interactivity to the next level by giving players the freedom to make decisions that influence the direction of the narrative. Our project seeks to implement a choice-driven narrative game on a smaller scale, featuring at least two decision points and branching paths based on player choices.
